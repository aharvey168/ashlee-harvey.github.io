/**
 * OPERATORS
 * 
 * OBJECTIVES:
 * - operators act on our data and perform arithmetic operations on them
 * - classifications: 
 *      1. Unary - work with 1 value
 *      2. Binary - work with 2 values
 *      3. Ternary - work with 3 values
 * 
 * TYPES
 * 1. Assignment
 * 2. Comparision
 *    - compare twp values and evaluate to true or false
 *    - binary comparison: <, >, <=, >=
 *    - strict comparison: ===, !==
 * 3. Arithmetic
 *    - math function that performs a calculation on two operands
 *    - (+) Addition
 *    - (-) Subtraction
 *    - (*) Multiplication
 *    - (/) Division

 *    - && And Operator
 *    - || OR Operator
 *    - ! Bang Operator
