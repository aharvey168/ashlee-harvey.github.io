/**
 * Types of Operators
 * 1. Assignment
 *  - assigns a value to a variable
 *  - equal (=)
 * 2. COMPARISION
 *  - compare two values and evlauate to a Boolean(true or false)
 *  - binary comparison: <, >, +, <=, >=
 *  - strict comparison: ===, ==, !==, !=
 * 3. ARITHMETIC
 *  - perform arithmetic on numbers
 *  - addition(+)
 *  - subtraction (-)
 *  - multiplication (*)
 *  - exponention (**)
 *  - division (/)
 *  - remainder (%)
 *  - increment (++)
 *  - decrement (--) 
 * 4. LOGICAL
 *  - && AND Op.: both conditions resolve to true
 *  - || OR Op  : one or the other must resolve to true
 *  - ! Bang Op : Flips the truthinessof the value
 *  - !! Double Bang : two bang operators together
 * 5. STRING
 *  - takes two or more string values and put them together to return another string which is the combo of the two input strings
 *  - concat op (+ or +=)
 * 6. CONDITIONAL(Ternary)
 *  - syntax: condition ? expresion if truthy ; expression if falsy
 * 7. UNARY
 *  - plus operator (+) precedes its operand and evaluates to its operand but attempts to convert it into a number if it isnâ€™t already.
 *  - negation operator (-) precedes its operand and negates it.
