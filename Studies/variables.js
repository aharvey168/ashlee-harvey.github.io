/**
VARIABLES

0. USE: To hold things in memory during the life-cycle of a program, we can use variables. 


Variable are names indentifiers that can point to values ofa particular type.

1. Variable types: number, string, boolean, array, object 

2. TWO Phases of USE: declaration and initialization
    Declaration : TO create variable we use the keyword follwed by a name for the variable name
        - key word(let, var, const) 
        - Examples:
            var		age
            let		name		
            const	amAnAdult
    Initialization: assingning a value to the variable by place the assignment operator follows by the variable n
                name
            Examples:
            =		28;
            =		“Ashlee”;	
            =	 	true;
