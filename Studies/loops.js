/**
 * LOOPS
 * 
 * OBJECTIVE:
 * - loops are features of Javscript that repeat(iterate) over or search through data 
 * - loops execute a block of code while iterating over a collection
 * - looping can be used to work with data one at a time
 * 
 * TYPES OF LOOPS
 * 1. for loop:
 *      - iterating over arrays
 *      - 3 statements needed: initialize the index, condition to stop looping, incrementing or decrementing our index by each loop
 *      - ex:   
 *          for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
 *          //
 *          }
 *          
 * - for - loop:
 *      -  pulls out all the keys of an object, one by one 
 *      -  ex:
 *          for (var key in person){
 *          
 * }
 * - while loop:
 *      - as long as a condition is true, the loop will execute the block of code
 *      - ex:
 *          var sum = +1;
 *          while (sum < 10){
 *             console.log(sum):
 *             sum++;  
 *          }
 *
